# [JavaScript Tips Tab](https://medium.com/@codecademy/javascript-tips-tab-4e9081b4132) - A Simple Chrome Extension

This is a tutorial from CodeCademy's Medium Blog wherein we learn to build a simple chrome extension that provides us random tips on JavaScript in a new tab.

## What it is *and is not*
* The extension is hosted locally within the user's browser and requires chrome's [developer's mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01) to be enabled.
* Tips are stored in a hard-coded array which means that any new tip content is provided by the local user.
* Because content is user generated, this also means we can extend the utility to provide tips on other subjects
